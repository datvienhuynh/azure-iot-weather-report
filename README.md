## PROJECT IDEA
This project develops an IoT solution using Azure IoT Hub to receive messages from some simulated devices that create random weather data (temperature, humidity, wind intensity, wind direction, rain) of two cities in Australia - Melbourne and Sydney. The data is then analysed and visualised to generate a weather report using Power BI.


## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7.x or 3.5.x (or later) on your development machine.  You can download Python for multiple platforms from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  You can verify the current version of Python on your development machine using 'python --version' or 'python3 --version'


## Resources
- [azure-iot-sdk-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python): contains the source code for Azure IoT Python SDK.
- [Azure IoT Hub Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/)
